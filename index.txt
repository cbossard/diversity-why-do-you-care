== What is diversity by the way?

It's not just about gender or ethnical origins

But also ages, social backgrounds, disabilities, languages, ...

== Definition

    <span class="fragment fade-out">A good way to smash those stereotypes is to do it as soon as possible.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Initiatives like Devoxx4Kids or Coding Goûter are great for that.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, in Nantes, we have been organising parent/children coding sessions for 4 years </span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">We have seen little girls become teenagers and still enjoy programming and that's really great!</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">A girl only came alongside her little brother who was really interested.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">During the first session, she only played with her phone</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">but started to look at what the others were doing</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">and finally, she has been coming back month after month, while her little brother never showed up again</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">And I must confess that sometimes, I keep organising those sessions just because of her.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">We can see that those sessions attract a lot of people and it's a really good thing!</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">But sadly, we often have to force parity so that girls may have time to apply</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">For example, in Nantes, when we are planning a Devoxx4kids event, we are providing girls and boys tickets.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">The content of the event is exactly the same for boys and for girls, but we are saving half of the tickets for girls.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Otherwise, all the tickets would we taken by boys.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Our next step will be to try and communicate more outside our IT world</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">and give access to this event to children who are not digital natives.</span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">Despite my tech-friendly environment, I chose to study computer science a bit by accident. </span>
	  </span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I was in high school, I discovered HTML and JavaScript (it was in 2000, when everyone was discovering how to create web pages).</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I liked the way we could build new things and decided to pursue my studies in computer science.</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I arrived at University, I saw that computer science was maybe not so attractive to young women.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">We were only 10 girls for 90 boys (and I was told it was a really "good" year!). </span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">After these 2 years, I had understood that programming was not a girls' thing.</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">So I decided to pursue my studies to become a project manager! </span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I arrived at my engineering school, where once again, there were only 10% of women... </span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">This time I can't remember any discrimination between boys and girls, maybe because I had become used to it.</span>

  <span class="fragment fade-out">Everything was fine, </span>

  <span class="fragment fade-in">

  </span>

  that women are not as good computer scientists and would have reason to exclude us.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-out">Well-being is not just about sexists jokes.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-out">There are many situations at work that can deteriorate team work</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, why can't people who are single take days off during school holidays? </span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Are they not allowed to spend time with their families?</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">
Speaking of holiday, realize that christian holidays is not the norm for everyone. </span>

    <span class="fragment fade-out">Please considerate that in your schedules.</span>

<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">If there are muslims in your team </span>

</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Be also careful on the distribution of tasks </span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">I have too often seen things like "Front-end for girls" / "Back-end for boys"</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Because, apparently, women know how to make pretty things</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Are you really sure about it? For instance, have you already seen me draw? (hint: it's really not pretty)</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Just ask people what they prefer to work on (be agile? :-D)</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Another thing you should be aware of, is meeting times</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Some people have to take care of loved ones / significant others and can't stay late,</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">some have buses to catch, some can't work efficiently in the morning...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">You are working with human beings, try to adapt!</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Just ask what the best time would be and timebox the meetings</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">You will see people more relaxed and able to concentrate on the discussions</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Last but not least, let's talk about clothes</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">I've noticed that every summer, the problem reappears</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Why can't we see men's legs at work while women can wear short skirts?</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Would it be the same if women didn't shave their legs? I have never been given a real answer to this question...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Nonetheless, equality goes both ways.</span>

A diverse group of problem-solvers usually has a better chance of outperforming a less diverse team, thanks to the broader range of experiences each member brings to the table.
