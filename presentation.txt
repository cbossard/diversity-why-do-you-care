== What is diversity by the way?

It's not just about gender or ethnical origins

But also ages, social backgrounds, disabilities, languages, ...

== Break the stereotypes

++++
Enfant, j'ai grandi dans une famille d'enseignants assez technophiles. Par exemple, mon père était enseignant dans une école primaire et initiait ses élèves à l'informatique
(ce qui n'était pas super fréquent dans les années 80). Tous les soirs, après avoir fait nos devoirs, nous nous occupions donc dans sa classe en attendant qu'il soit prêt en jouant avec les ordinateurs.
J'ai donc eu la chance d'y avoir accès très tôt dans ma vie, et sans barrière (nous étions libres d'y faire ce que nous souhaitions, sachant que les possibilités étaient de toute façon assez limitées !)

== Break the stereotypes

image:maths.jpeg[Girls suck at maths]


+++
Jamais je n'ai entendu à mon encontre des phrases telles que "Les filles ne peuvent pas faire ci" ou "les garçons ne peuvent pas faire ça". Mais plus tard, je me suis rendue compte des barrières qui étaient
posées aux enfants de part les stéréotypes : la technique n'est pas un truc de filles. Seuls les garçons peuvent être bons en sciences.
Je suis très heureuse de ne pas avoir vécu ce genre de situation. Je me pose la question de ce que j'aurais pu faire si ça avait été le cas. Aurais-je tout de même poursuivi dans ce domaine?
Honnêtement, je n'en suis absolument pas sûre...

<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">A good way to break those stereotypes is to smash them as soon as possible.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Initiatives like Devoxx4Kids or Coding Goûter are great for that.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, in Nantes, We have been organising parent/children coding session for 4 years </span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">We have seen little girls become teenagers and still enjoy programming and that's really great!</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">A girl only came along her little brother who was really interested.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">During the first session, she only played with her phone</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">but started to look at what the others were doing</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">and finally, she has been coming back month after month, while her little brother never showed up again :-)</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">And I must confess that sometimes, I keep organising those sessions just because of her.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">We can see that those sessions attract a lot of people and it's a really good thing!</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">But sadly, we often have to force parity so that girls may have time to apply</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">For example, in Nantes, when we are planning a devoxx4kids event, we are providing girls and boys tickets.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">The content of the event is exactly the same for boys and for girls, but we are saving half of the tickets for girls.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Otherwise, all the tickets would be taken by boys.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Our next step will be to try to communicate more outside our IT world</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">and give access to this event to children who are not digital natives.</span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I was in high school, I discovered HTML and Javascript (it was in 2000, when everyone was discovering how to create web pages).</span>

	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">Nonetheless, maybe out of sheer stubbornness, I decided to stay.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">In 2nd year, there were even fewer girls... </span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">After these 2 years, I had understood that programming was not a girls' thing.</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">So I decided to pursue my studies to become a project manager! </span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I arrived at my engineering school, where once again, there were only 10% of women... </span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">This time I can't remember any discrimination between boys and girls, maybe because I had become used to it.</span>

      <span class="fragment fade-in">
          <span class="fragment fade-out">An other way to "attract diversity" into STEM, is to associate disciplines to a meaning</span>

          <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, instead of naming your training "Deep dive into Machine learning"</span>

          <span class="fragment fade-out">you could try "Increase organic farming performance through statistics and algorithm "</span>

Mind your words
Les mots blessent très facilement. Nous n'avons pas la possibilité de relire ce que l'ont dit. Une fois que c'est dit, c'est trop tard.

Parrainage : je ne sais pas si vous avez été dans une situation où vous avez eu un parrain ou une marraine lors de vos études, mais est ce que vous vous souvenez de la façon dont ils étaient attribués ?
Dans mon cas, que ce soit à l'IUT ou en école d'ingénieur, c'était le bureau des étudiants qui s'occupait de faire les attributions de filleuls.
Et bizarrement, tous les membres du bureau "s'attribuaient" les filles de la promo. Il est alors difficile de croire qu'ils choisissaient les filleuls sans arrière pensée...
Comment dans ces cas là compter sur son parrain pour être bienveillant et lui conter nos éventuels soucis d'intégration ?

== Well-being

<footer class="title-footer">

Well-being is not just about sexists jokes.


It is somthing that is felt more than seen.

<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">There are also little actions at work that can help enhance the situation</span>
</span>

For instance, why can't persons who are singles have holidays during school holidays? Are they not allowed to take care of their nephews?
Speaking of holiday, realize that christian holidays is not the norm for everyone. Pease considerate that in your schedules.

<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">If people are muslims in your team </span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">try to avoid a big launch of your project during Ramadan</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">They might not be really effective and people might blame them because of their religion</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Whereas nobody is deploying a new version of a software for Christmas...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Be also careful on the tasks distribution</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">I have too often seen things like "Front-end for girls" / "Back-end for boys"</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Because, apparently, women know how to make pretty things</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Are you really sure about it? For instance, have you already seen me draw ? (hint : it's really not pretty)</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Just ask people what they prefer to work on (be agile? :-D)</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Another thing you should be aware of, is meeting times</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Some people have to take care of loved ones / significant others and can't stay late,</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">some have buses to catch, some can't work efficiently in the morning...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">You are working with human beings, try to adapt!</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Maybe just ask what the best time would be and timebox the meetings</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">You will see people more relaxed and able to concentrate on the discussions</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Last but not least, let's talk about clothes</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">I've noticed that every summer, the problem reappears</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Why can't we see men's legs at work while women can wear short skirts ?</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Would it be the same if women didn't shave their legs ? I have never been given a real answer to this question...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Nonetheless, equality goes both ways.</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">When talking about a framework, make sure everyone knows it or again, take time to explain.</span>

     <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">It's during such conversations that people can feel that they are set aside and do not belong.</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">or talk about a really "sexy" framework</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">Some expression can be offensive towards people even when it is not meant to be.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">And a little thing that happens really often, is using the word "guys" to mean "people" or "all".</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">It's actually not a gender neutral word... It might be felt like a daily reminder that women can not be part of the team.</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">While speaking is important, listening is even more important!</span>

== Motherhood
developers = children?

<footer class="title-footer">
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">When I had my first child, after my maternity leave,</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">I could start managing people and projects. What?!?!</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Just because I could barely manage my 3 months old daughter, it meant I could manage a bunch of developers and clients? </span>
	</span>
What I really saw was that I was not treated as my male colleagues concerning parenthood.
When my daughters are sick, I am the one who is called by the school, even though my husband is working at home. We are supposed to take care of our children while the father is working.
I thought we were in 2018, not in 1818?

== Why is diversity even important?
[quote]
___________________________________________
A diverse group of problem-solvers usually has a better chance of outperforming a less diverse team, thanks to the broader range of experiences each member brings to the table.

<footer class="title-footer">
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">OK. But why do we need diversity among our teams?</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Diversity among a group of problem solvers is more important than individual excellence.</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">People from different backgrounds do, on average, tend to approach work and problem solving differently. </span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">And solving problem is exactly what we do every day!</span>
