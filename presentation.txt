== What is diversity by the way ? 

It's not just about gender or ethnical origins
 
But also ages, social backgrounds, disabilities, languages, ...

		<span class="fragment fade-out">I chose to study computer science a bit by accident. </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I was in high school, I discovered HTML and Javascript (it was in 2000, when everyone was discovering how to create web pages).</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I liked the way we could build new things and decided to pursue my studies in computer science.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I arrived at University, I saw that computer science was maybe not really so attractive to young women.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">We were only 10 girls for 90 boys (and I was told it was a really good year !). </span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">I don't remember my classmates beeing sexist or so, </span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">but I clearly remember some of my teachers not talking to girls or making it clear we didn't belong here.</span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">Nonetheless, maybe because I'm stubborn, I decided to stay.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">In 2nd year, there were even fewer girls... </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">After these 2 years, I had understood that programming was not a girls' thing.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">So I decided to pursue my studies to become a project manager ! </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I arrived at my engineering school, where once again, there were only 10% of women... </span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">This time, maybe because I was prepared and used to it, but I can't remember any discrimination between boys and girls.</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">But still, I heard people around me say things like "You chose to study computer science only to find a good husband".</span> 
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">(By the way, do you ask nurse or a teacher if they chose this job to find a wife ?)</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">As an aside : It's exactly the same with video games.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">But every time I was presented to clients, I was told to wear a dress or a skirt.</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">Did the client only choose me because of my legs or was it because I had the required technical competences ? </span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Was it only to "feminize" the work place ? People told me it was an asset to be a woman, but I saw this as a burden.</span>

A diverse group of problem-solvers usually has a better chance of outperforming a less diverse team, thanks to the broader range of experiences each member brings to the table.

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">An other way to "attract diversity" into STEM, is to associate disciplines to a meaning</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, instead of naming your training "Deep dive into Machine learning"</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">you could try "Increase organic farming performance through statistics and algorithm "</span>

<footer class="title-footer">
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">There are also little actions at work that can help enhance the situation</span>
	</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, be carefull on the tasks distribution</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">I have too often seen things like "Front-end for girls" / "Back-end for boys"</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Because, apparently, women know how to make pretty things</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">You are working with human beings, try to adapt !</span>
    </span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Maybe just ask what the best time would be and timebox the meetings</span>
    </span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">You will see people more relaxed and able to concentrate on the discussions</span>
    </span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Last but not least, let's talk about clothes</span>
    </span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">I've noticed that every summer, the problem reappears</span>
    </span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">Why can't we see men's legs at work while women can wear short skirts ?</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">When talking about a framework, make sure everyone knows it or again, take time to explain.</span>

     <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">It's during such conversations that people can feel that they are set aside and do not belong here.</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">or talk about a really "sexy" framework</span>
	</span> 
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Some expression can be offensive towards people even when it is not meant to be.</span>
	</span> 
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">And a little thing that happen really often, is using the word "guys" to mean "people".</span>
	</span> 
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">It's actually not a gender neutral word... It might be felt like a daily reminder that women can not be part of the team.</span>
	</span> 
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">While speaking is important, listening is even more important !</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
        <span class="fragment fade-out">Try to listen to people and let them speak, particuly in meetings.</span>
	</span>

        <span class="fragment fade-out">Make sure every one had the same opportunity to express their opinion, men as women, juniors as seniors.</span>

== The goal is not to have a perfect diverse team but a team with enough diversity 

== Diversity attracts diversity
The problem becomes exponentially easier to solve once you’ve begun to solve it ^^

== We work with others + we care about our job = we should care about others
