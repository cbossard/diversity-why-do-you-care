== What is diversity by the way ?

It's not only about gender or ethnical origins

But also ages, social backgrounds, disabilities, languages, ...

		<span class="fragment fade-out">Despite my tech-friendly environment, I chose to study computer sciences a bit by accident. </span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I was in high school, I discovered HTML and Javascript (it was in 2000, when everyone was discovering how to create web pages).</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I liked the way we could build new things and decided to pursue my studies in computer science.</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">When I arrived at University, I saw that computer science was maybe not so attractive to young women.</span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">We were only 10 girls for 90 boys (and I was told it was a really good year !). </span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">After these 2 years, I had understood that programming was not a girls' thing.</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">So I decided to pursue my studies to become a project manager ! </span>
	</span>
    <span class="fragment fade-in">
		<span class="fragment fade-out">I arrived at my engineering school, where once again, there were only 10% of women... </span>

		<span class="fragment fade-out">This time I can't remember any discrimination between boys and girls, maybe because I was prepared and used to it.</span>

== How to enhance the proportion of women in STEM ?
- Provide mentorship and role models

  	</span>
      <span class="fragment fade-in">
          <span class="fragment fade-out">An other way to "attract diversity" into STEM, could be to associate disciplines to a meaning</span>

      <span class="fragment fade-in">
          <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, instead of naming your training "Deep dive into Machine learning"</span>

      <span class="fragment fade-in">
          <span class="fragment fade-out">you could try "Increase organic farming performance through statistics and algorithm "</span>

      <span class="fragment fade-in">
          <span class="fragment fade-out">The content of the training would be the same, but you will not have only maths geek students ;-)</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-out">Well-being is not just about sexists jokes.</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">There are many situations at work that can deteriorate team work</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">For instance, why can't single person have vacation during school holidays ? </span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Are they not allowed to spend time with their families ?</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">
Speaking of holiday, realize that christian holidays is not the norm for everyone. </span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Please considerate that in your schedules.</span>

<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">If people are muslims in your team </span>

<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">try to avoid a big launch of your project during Ramadan</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-out">They might not be really effective and people might blame them because of their religion</span>

    <span class="fragment fade-out">Whereas nobody is deploying a new version of a software for Christmas...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Be also carefull on the tasks distribution</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">I have too often seen things like "Front-end for girls" / "Back-end for boys"</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Because, apparently, women know how to make pretty things</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Are you really sure about it ? For instance, have you already seen me draw ? (hint : it's really not pretty)</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Just ask people what they prefer to work on (be agile ? :-D)</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Another thing you should be aware of, is meeting times</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Some people have to take care of loved ones / significant others and can't stay late,</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">some have buses to catch, some can't work efficiently in the morning...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">You are working with human beings, try to adapt !</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Just ask what the best time would be and timebox the meetings</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">You will see people more relaxed and able to concentrate on the discussions</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Last but not least, let's talk about clothes</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">I've noticed that every summer, the problem reappears</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Why can't we see men's legs at work while women can wear short skirts ?</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Would it be the same if women didn't shave their legs ? I have never been given a real answer to this question...</span>
</span>
<span class="fragment fade-in">
    <span class="fragment fade-out">Nonetheless, equality goes both ways.</span>

== Why is diversity even important ?

___________________________________________
A diverse group of problem-solvers usually has a better chance of outperforming a less diverse team, thanks to the broader range of experiences each member brings to the table.
